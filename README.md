#  Salesforce Pet Adoption Tracker  

##  Project Overview  
The **Salesforce Pet Adoption Tracker** is a cloud-based application designed to streamline and automate the pet adoption process for animal shelters and NGOs.  

Traditional adoption workflows rely heavily on manual tracking, spreadsheets, and paper forms, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and poor adopter experiences.  

This project leverages **Salesforce CRM capabilities** to build a centralized system that:  
- Manages **pet profiles** with details such as breed, age, health, and availability.  
- Tracks **adopters and adoption requests** in a structured manner.  
- Automates **communication workflows**, including adoption confirmations and follow-ups.  
- Provides **real-time dashboards and reports** to monitor adoption trends and shelter performance.  

By replacing manual processes with a digital, scalable solution, the Pet Adoption Tracker empowers shelters to:  
- Reduce administrative workload.  
- Enhance transparency and collaboration between stakeholders.  
- Improve adopter satisfaction with faster, more reliable communication.  
- Increase adoption rates and positively impact animal welfare.
